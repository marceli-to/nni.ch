        text: "Color is an integral part of the visual experience of humans. Through color, we receive a wealth of information about light, materials, and textures, which is critical during our interaction with our environment. In our image-making context, color can either make or break a scene. Using it correctly can help us convey the intended mood and guide the viewer to what's important. Using it wrongly can destroy continuity, impair realism, or otherwise disturb and confuse the viewer."

Notice, also, how minimal the color palette is. Almost no other color hues exist outside the midnight blue and golden yellow. This ensures clarity and readability. The brain only reads two areas: the blue background and yellow figures. This image is abstract in many ways. We just get fooled by the wealth of details and textures — and this is where true mastery comes in and makes the difference."

The hierarchy is consistent between all three channels."

This is possible because the two colors that were chosen are once again complementary and are, thus, in high contrast with each other. The compositional advantage of this move is huge: first, the background is clearly and boldly distinguished from the foreground and the two are nicely balanced together. Second, the border between the two areas (the silhouette of the architectural elements) is easily readable. And third, it overall contributes to a low information scene, where after grasping the main idea, the viewer is free to discover finer details and textures.'

Mastering these skills will give us the ability to create simpler but more sophisticated scenes — to say more with less. This, for example, is more evident in graphic-style and abstract works where color is the primary compositional tool.'
