        text: 'As a provider of Computer Generated Images (CGI), we''re relying on good hardware to generate our images. A good workstation is important for an efficient workflow and also helps to reach a good quality, which requires fine-tuning by using a good amount of "test-renderings". In addition to our workstations, we have a dedicated in-house render farm to generate our intermediate renderings and final products.'

Our current strategy is something in between. We have settled on a strong workstation, not the most powerful possible, but something fast and with a good price/speed ratio."

However, in the past, using AMD, we have experienced difficulties in terms of multi-tasking, as it was almost impossible to render and work on an AMD computer simultaneously and that was the case for several AMD computers we ordered. Maybe the latest AMD chips are better in that regard but we're currently not testing them again. However, this is the reason why we have chosen Intel over AMD."

It would be nice to have 256, but the price tag for that is still quite high, so we've elected 128 with the possibility to upgrade those later to 256. The speed of the RAM (MHz) is not that important to us."
