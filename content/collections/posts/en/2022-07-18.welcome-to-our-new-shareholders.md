I do believe that organisations thrive with self-determination not only in the structure but in ownership as well. I hope that the diversity on the board just like in our team will bring brighter futures for all.”'

Regarding her background in economics, she applied for the position of maternity cover as\_Assistant Administration, a position advertised with the name \"Mission\". Rukiye got the job and was quickly asked to\_join permanent as Assistant to the Board. At this time the founders were building up for switching to Holacracy, which happened shortly after. However, this shift meant that Rukiye \"lost\" her role as Assistant to the Board, due to the structure of Holacracy, where there is no board in the traditional sense. Instead, she became our HR specialist and now she is also our new shareholder:"
