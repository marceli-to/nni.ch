        text: "\_project — a plan to revitalize the Limmat river between Schlieren, Oberengstringen, and Unterengstringen. Over the length of more than three kilometers, a near-natural river landscape is created, one that offers a dynamically changing green oasis for the local population and becomes a hotspot of biodiversity. The Limmat breaks its rigid boundaries and takes back what was taken from it."

        text: 'On the technical front, this required a heavy reliance on post-production and matte painting techniques and an organic and inventive blending of 2D and 3D elements. And that is without forgetting the challenge of taking the perfect drone photo to use as a backdrop. On the creative front, with nature no longer being just the context but the main character, new focal elements had to be considered. The lines of the landscape were used to drive the eye around and a strategic use of color was utilised to define areas of interest inside the image. In the cases where the camera was close enough to the river, people were used as means for storytelling. Finally, there was the challenge of staying true to the place, so that people can recognize it and relate to it, while still implying new atmospheres, qualities, and purposes. And this “new” had to be very specific: the animal species, types of vegetation and terrains seen in the images were all precisely defined in the client brief.'

As revealed by the brief above, they approached us with a very clear idea about what the images should communicate and what the overall aesthetic should be. Throughout the process, they managed to provide well-structured and unified feedback, combining a variety of inputs from all involved parties.'
