        text: 'The process begins with creating a 3D model of the building and its surroundings. If we receive 2D plans, we use Rhino3D to model the initial 3D model. Rhino3D is a versatile tool for creating 3D drawings, especially for complex shapes. Once the model is complete, we export it to 3D Studio Max, our specialized 3D software that is known for its versatility and endless plugins and add-ons.'

        text: 'With 3D Studio Max, we set the scene, place the cameras, and add lighting to the scene. We then assign materials to the surfaces, and populate the scene with furniture, accessories, people, and landscapes. For landscape elements, we use a special plugin called Forest Pack. With its ability to manage huge scenes with many elements, 3D Studio Max allows us to handle even very complex projects efficiently.'

        text: "To generate the final image, we use Corona Renderer, a render engine that in our opinion delivers the best image quality and natural-looking images. The render engine is completely integrated as a plugin into 3D Studio Max. After the image is generated, we use Photoshop to refine it further. We integrate the image into a photograph or add background photos, people, and landscape elements. We fine-tune the image's contrast and colors, and add effects or abstractions to enhance the image's look and feel."

        text: 'Our process and the interactions with the client, involves jumping between the various software programs used. If there are geometry corrections to be made, we use Rhino3D or modify the model directly in 3DS Max, depending on what works best. Other image corrections can either be done in 3D or Photoshop, depending on the situation. In many cases, doing them in 3D and re-rendering is the cleaner solution, but it might take more time. We use a self-written script to replace our renderings within the Photoshop file.'

Then, for a longer period, we used Rhino 3D in combination with Maxwell Render for our images. Since a few years, we've switched to Corona Render in combination with Cinema 4D or 3D Studio Max. Just recently, we've decided to focus solely on 3D Studio Max to simplify our internal structure."
