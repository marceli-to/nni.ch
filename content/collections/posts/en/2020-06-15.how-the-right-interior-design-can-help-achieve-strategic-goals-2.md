        text: "' building programs and discussed how these can foster or limit movement and knowledge flows. The thing is, no matter the building program it needs to be easy for the users to decode functions and flows. From a psychological perspective, humans rely on their ability to read and understand their surroundings. If a space and its functions are not clear the brain will naturally read danger, and what we will see is that the users feel uncomfortable and do not use the full potential of a space. Therefore, it is utterly important that interior designers understand and consider how a room is perceived - and create rooms that are easy for users to understand, in order for them to feel comfortable and use them as intended."

        text: 'A strongly controlled building program has a structure in which movement and knowledge flow are restrained by strict building and room structures – rather than the interior design and layout. This creates highly controlled interfaces between space and people. A loose and less controlled space program will look more like a beehive with streams of people and activity crossing, which facilitates a higher degree of seemingly random movements and static spaces where encounters between people can occur.'

        text: 'It is often easier to design a highly controlled building program because you can redefine what functions and actions you want to take place in each room, and thus, create pre-defined interfaces between the space and people. In the example below, nine rooms are furnished with office functions, providing highly controlled activity streams. This could just as well have been rooms arranged for recovering patients in a hospital, the point is the same; there is no surprise in what functions and activities that would take place in these rooms.'

When we use such symbols to decode our surroundings, mathematical experiments have shown that we spend less energy decoding the world around us. Evolutionarily, it means that we are better at surviving when we turn reality into symbols – the faster and better we are at reading different situations, the better we are at surviving (Roberto Verganti, Innovation Strategies, 2006).\_"

However, if we stick too rigidly to these symbols it can also occur that it actually takes us longer to understand a room if, for example, an office has an oval and not a square desk.'

In order to decode functions, it is now necessary to broaden our focus and look at the people using the furniture. This is often what scares us that we now have to deal with both space, furniture, and people. For what navigation system do we now use to feel comfortable in surroundings with multiple sensory impressions?'

So, when we must choose between the object-related and the subject-related approach, the choice naturally will fall on the objective approach. Nevertheless, it is also very human to have a subjective approach to the furniture, especially when there is a human behind the furniture. thus the brain might be working a bit on overtime in a more loosey-controlled setting.'

And it is often heard that people become more tired from the many sensory impressions that are in open offices than people who work in single offices. Precisely because the subject-related sensory impression is so complex and consists of so many sub-elements. Thus, especially, in the loosely managed building program, placement and use of fixtures must have a clear purpose, otherwise, it will seem silly and cause irritation.'

This could be done by clearly incorporating a brush of nature in the interior design, including, colors, materials, and textures that represent the element. For many, it is probably easy to imagine how nature can be integrated into the design of a space. Lots of plant containers, small trees, or living plants as dividing walls are now common in many offices. On the other hand, this is a very original concept that already exists in many offices, and thus you will really be tested on your creativity if this is the design concept of choice.'
