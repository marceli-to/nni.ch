        text: 'In January, our Buenos Aires-based 3D-modeler, Guido Ventura, traveled 18 hours from Buenos Aires to Zurich, to meet the Zurich team and exchange knowledge with some of our skilled visualizers. This was an important meeting that has helped us developed the way we work together across continents, but it also showed us the complete and utter uniqueness of our team. Here Guido brings his story.'

Last year (2019), we made a huge step forward software-wise in the company, as our Zurich and New York offices started running Cinema 4D. Meanwhile, we kept working with the same program (Rhino) in Buenos Aires.'

However, with time we realized that if we really wanted to understand and match our modeling skills to the new situation, we had to roll up our sleeves and learn it. And so we did.'

During this process, I actually came to model a creepy robot and a horrible airplane... But hey, it is still something. I kept learning until it came to the point that I felt like I needed to move to the next step and be included in some proper modeling work that was more directly related to the work we do in Nightnurse Images.'

Landing in Zurich I was met by the Swiss winter and my lovely and awesome Tereza Vyhlidalova, also visualizer in Nightnurse Images - and probably the best host I could ask for. That same day, jetlagged and all, a welcome party was thrown for me, without any sleep, I got to meet almost every member of the Zurich team. And I learned that it is pronounced \_and not , as we as Spanish speakers would say - or at least, I used to do.\""
