Because of this positive experience, the architects started telling their colleagues the story about ‘the crazy guys that worked all night’, which spread like rings on water and lead to more commissioned jobs. As jobs kept coming the workload grew more time-attentive. Christoph, Christoper, and Lutz decided to go all in, they quit their full-time jobs and in 2010 Nightnurse Images were founded.\_"

Specific image styles or visual expressions tend to be industry- or sector related. Architects intend to sell their designs. Thus, it is essential that visualizations made for architects touch the spectator’s imagination and stimulates her/his senses. However, especially in real estate marketing, the tendency leans more towards a desire for a more realistic visual expression, captured on an aesthetically good-looking day. Creating an image with a photo-realistic style and a mood that leaves the spectator with a positive impression, which is what you look for when you sell real estate.\_"
