        text: 'The short and boring answer to this is that building projects are intellective processes that last years and includes decisions that have to be taken appropriate to one another. And that building projects including tons of decisions regarding design, needs, function, materials, sustainability, budget, technology, legal permits, location, stakeholder expectations, execution and more. Therefore, many things can change over the years of planning and latter building and since changes affect one another it is plain logic that an architectural visualization of a given design most likely will vary from the finished result.'

Even though visualisation is a marketing tool it also is an artistic discipline and a paid service.'

Disappointment may occur from time to time when the 'promised' design is not delivered. However, it is important to remember that the information that is transferred within an architectural visualization is much more than just the visual appearance of the design."
