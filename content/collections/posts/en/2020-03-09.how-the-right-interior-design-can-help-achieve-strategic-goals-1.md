        text: 'Spatial conditions shape people’s behavior, hence, utilizing space purposefully is important for its functionality. If the function of a space is unclear or disruptive it will nudge odd behavioral patterns that counteract the intentions of the space and its interior design. It all comes down to having the right space management. We have gotten a generous contribution – that dives into this topic – from Inger Ravn, Copenhagen based Architect and specialist in space management. In this blog post, she shares her thoughts, experience, and inspiration from her many years working with space.'

One very important thing is the layout, how space is placed in a certain order. Every room in a building is related to one another and this relationship instinctively often makes sense to the people using them. Every room has, so to speak, a well-defined function to fulfill.'

This ambiance contributes to the narrative of how the room can or should be used, whilst relations to other rooms is expressed by the social activities that take place in the room. In conclusion, space and décor are expressed through three elements: Function, Relation, and Style (Figure 1).'

On the contrary, are restaurants and cafes, which are open to relationship building and socializing, these are what we would call loosely controlled spaces.'

We classify rooms and fixtures according to our knowledge and past experiences. Thus, if we change the interrelationships of rooms, we also change the way we move in these rooms. Figure 2, on the left side, shows ‘Room Relations’ shown by three squares with nine identical spaces. The three squares illustrate how the flow changes throughout the process depending on how to get to the next room(s).'
