        text: 'Color is an integral part of the visual experience of humans. Through color, we receive a wealth of information about light, materials, and textures, critical during our interaction with our environment. In our image-making context, color can either make or break a scene. Using it correctly can help us convey the intended mood and guide the viewer to what’s important. Using it wrongly can destroy continuity, impair realism, or otherwise disturb and confuse the viewer. In short, color can be considered our primary tool in creating a believable image.'
