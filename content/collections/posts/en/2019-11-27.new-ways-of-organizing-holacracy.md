        text: "Holacracy is a holistic organizational management system that focuses on, in a purposeful manner, optimizing a companies' flexibility and productivity. It is based on the notion that companies should be sensing their organization from the bottom-up: through the employees rather than top-down, through the management, in order to be innovative and progressive."

        text: 'So how does that happen? Holacracy realizes that one of the skills we human beings are best at is sensing when something is not as good as it could be. We sense - and often express - when circumstances from every aspect of our lives could be better. This sensation of potential between current reality and an improved state has a name in Holacracy: it is simply called a tension. And whereas tensions in most other contexts have a negative connotation, in Holacracy they are the driver that initiates every improvement. How that? Holacracy offers a clear pathway to every individual working in the system, to address and process tensions and improve the whole.'

We consider this to be essential for a young company in a high paced industry, like Nightnurse Images, to grow sustainably from the inside out. This is aided by the Holacracy system because the management of everyday matters is distributed onto multiple roles instead of individual managers.\_"
