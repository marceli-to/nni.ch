These kinds of events are maybe one of the privileges of being a bigger team, but it is also an active choice that we choose to learn from the images our team votes for as the best image of this month. Here is Chris explaining the image-making process as he did to our team.'

For the decision on the point of view, the project lead came by the office, had a sit down with me, and together we tested and figured out the best point of view for the project. This sit-down process helped us look at the projects more as a whole and not get lost in unimportant details'

Because they needed to be positioned strategically to not cover important parts of the outside, but at the same time show the actual door, which is an important part of the design. Other than that the interior is kept very simple to not catch too much attention, as it is not really important to the story of the image. Instead, I put emphasis on the details that I added to the outside because this is where I wanted the viewer’s eye to go'
