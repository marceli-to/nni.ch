        text: 'In ancient times the flamingo was related to concepts such as rarity and luxury and associated with something exotic due to its origin from warmer climes. Thus, often portrayed in romanticized pictures and paradise-like settings, almost like a mythical creature. The ancient portrayal of the bird is found all over the world e.g. as hieroglyphs in Egypt, in mosaics in Libya and the synagogue of Gaza Maiumas (Israel).'

However, the pink bird managed a great comeback around 2015 where it got embraced by big fashion houses such as Marc Jacobs, Gucci, and Bottega Veneta. Since then the flamingo regained its status as a symbol as something rare, exotic and luxurious.'
