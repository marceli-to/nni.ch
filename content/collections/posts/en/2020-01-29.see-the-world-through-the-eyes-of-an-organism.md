The exhibition invites visitors not only to reflect on climate change - as a consequence of human activity - but also to understand the position of humans as part of a larger system. The socially and ecologically committed artist, who was appointed ambassador for climate protection and sustainable energy by the UN in September 2019, pleads for a world that focuses on coexistence and cooperation instead of competition'
