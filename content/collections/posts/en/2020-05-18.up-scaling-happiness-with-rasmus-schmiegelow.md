A subscription-based start-up that on a monthly basis provides its more than 100,000 members with a box full of beauty products."

Pretty far from being a cosmetics entrepreneur and selling happiness as I do now. Therefore it was a big step coming from a super traditional set-up - as law firms typically are - and going into the startup world.'

The drive and the ambition, from Nikolaj and I, was to create a company that we would have loved to be working in ourselves. We wanted to have full influence on making people happy. That was the core ambition when we started and that is still the core ambition today. We do not see Goodiebox as a beauty or cosmetics company, we are a happiness company, both towards our members, investors, brand partners and so forth, but most definitely towards our employees.'

Maybe it is old-school to talk about work-life balance, today it is much more popular to talk about finding your purpose, but in the end, it is about priority.'

Goodiebox today is a completely different company compared to what it was one year ago and with the current growth. Probably in 12 months' time, it will be a completely different company again. Therefore, I constantly need to look at the organization, what worked six months ago probably won't work in six months. To adapt I always have to be ready to make the necessary changes to the organization. Also with colleagues that we are super happy about, they might not be in the right place just because Goodiebox is growing so much and so fast."

The learning is to just be even more bullish than you think you have to be in regard to the quality of the people you take in. Try to hire two years in advance, get people in that might be too expensive for the current state of the business. There are only two things that can stop Goodiebox from reaching its full potential, one is running out of money and the second is not having the right people on board.\_"

The original budget for that campaign was 19.000 € and they just wanted to bump it up with 5.000 €. So it would go from 19.000 € to 24.000 €. However, because we did not have the right processes in place, a human mistake meant that we went from 19.000 € to 2.4 million €. Luckily, we realized after an hour, but in the last part of that hour, we were spending 2.000 € per minute. Meaning that we ended up spending 39.000 € in that hour alone. '

Beauty taps into something where people are engaged, as most women and more and more men have strong feelings with their cosmetics. So what we saw was a hole in the market with high involvement, massive potential and underserved by digital. Moreover, the predictions for this category are that the global beauty market capital will grow to 850 billion $ in 2023, and within those years the digital scope will go from 7% to 15%. So, it is a market with high growth and an even higher digital growth - that was a good place to start.'

Eight years ago, we were testing out a lot of stuff and right now we are doing great beauty products, but in reality, it could be anything. The real drive was that we wanted to start a company where the people could fulfill their full potential and develop as employees because we identified that this is a big part of feeling happy. Going to work should not be a necessary evil just to have a paycheck, but something that could support our employee’s professional and personal purpose, while at the same time bringing happiness to our members. That is the core DNA.'

Therefore, we are completely transparent with our employees; we need to know what they can use Goodiebox as a stepping stone, to make their time with us worth it. When a new person starts with Goodiebox we make a development plan that enables them to go from A to wherever they want to go. Meaning that when they leave Goodiebox in five years' time, Goodiebox will have gone from a market capitalization of X to a market capitalization of 10X - but so will they; their market capital will also have increased 10X in that period of time where we worked together. The thought is that whatever their ambition might be, the time with Goodiebox should help take our employees closer to their ambitions."

Including how we recruit, how we do employee branding, how we do onboarding of new team members and how we make sure we have the right talent program in place so that everyone can develop within the organization. But just as equally important, people will also leave us, which is perfectly okay, but then we also look at how we can do offboarding in the best possible way. Making sure that these people continue being Goodiebox ambassadors even though they move on to work at a different place. '

This might mean that we need to make a really high investment in the short-term: The current record in Team Happiness (Customer Care) is 4 hours and 48 min., which was spent on one phone call with a member. The return on investment on that specific member I could never make sense of - but it tells the right story to our organization because this is just how we treat our members and we must always take time to do so. This is also why we do not have Customer Service, instead, we have Team Happiness. In Team Happiness there work no Agents but instead Happiness Heroes. Lastly, we do not have Tickets - you would never treat your friend as a Ticket - instead, we have Happy Moments. Happiness is just a penetrating factor in everything we do and that is also why we differentiate from our competitors and that is really also a crucial part of our success."

What works in Denmark does not directly translate into other countries that is why we started doing anthropology studies in all the different markets. Our studies told us that in for example Denmark women feel that they just deserve happiness, the danish women do not need a reason for deserving happiness. In the Netherlands, we found that women need to feel that they have done something to deserve this happiness or special me-time. This is, of course, a bit generalizing because it is an anthropology study that tells us about the median of the general Danish or Netherlandish women. So, this approach is a big part of our strategy to set up in a new country and it has proven to have a pretty positive impact on conversion when we tailor our content to a specific location.\_"

They own the new market six days prior to launch and 90 days after, they then hand over the keys to a country manager. Moreover, this New Market Launch Team has a playbook, including instructions on everything from setting up the right payment gateways to an indexation model that looks at demographics, digital spend, GDP, media cast, competitor situation, and so on. This whole indexation sums up the total value that is a guideline for where to launch next.'

So far, we have launched in countries that are very similar to Denmark in size, such as the Netherlands, or in culture, such as Sweden. In November 2019, we launched in Germany, which is the biggest beauty market in Europe. Continuing this focus on the bigger markets is our goal for 2020 and we will launch in France and the UK.'

        text: 'Whatever you do it is a people business. You might think that now you are in fintech or something that might not directly involve people, but regardless of that everything is a people business. It is all about the people you get on board, your employees are what stops you or enables your success. You cannot do everything yourself, even if you think you are the smartest person in the world - you are not - which is why it is so crucial that you hire people that are smarter than you are. If you cannot hire these people right away, then hook up with them or make sure that you learn other entrepreneurs and their experiences. Have mentors. Spend time on building your own network. You do not have time to reinvent the wheel or make all the mistakes that they have already made. That is my best advice.'
