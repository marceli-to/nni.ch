        text: ' Gstaad is a house and an art installation by Doug Aitken. The house was installed in the Swiss Alps, in Videmanette, Gstaad in February 2019 and will be experienceable until February 2021. However, the house is not only worth a one-time visit, as it changes along with the seasons and the weather. Thus, creating a new experience for the visitor on any day of the year.'

Though the house is inspired by American architecture, it can be viewed as similar to a classical Swiss Alpine cabin.'
