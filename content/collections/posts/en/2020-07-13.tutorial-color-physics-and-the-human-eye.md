        text: "Color is an integral part of the visual experience of humans. Through color, we receive a wealth of information about light, materials, and textures, critical during our interaction with our environment. In our image-making context, color can either make or break a scene. Using it correctly can help us convey the intended mood and guide the viewer to what's important. Using it wrongly can destroy continuity, impair realism, or otherwise disturb and confuse the viewer. In short, color can be considered our primary tool in creating a believable image."

Still, a quick glance at how humans perceive it and how it is connected to light will surely do no harm! This will be the only technical chapter. Everything that will follow will focus on the artistic side of things.'

        text: ". Without going into great detail, let's say that light, after passing through the pupil and the lens, meets the retina, which functions much like the film in a camera. The retina is made of photoreceptor cells which come in two main types: rods and cones (there's also a third one but we'll not worry about it here). Rods are sensitive to light intensity while cones are sensitive to light wavelength which, as we've seen, corresponds to color! Signals from the cones are sent to the brain which translates these messages into the perception of color."

This knowledge may not have a direct effect on the process of crafting an image but it helps us adopt a more scientific position in our domain. Our job is to play with human perception (visual perception in our case) in order to convey certain meanings. The more we know about it, the better our messages will be."
