                text: 'It will become easier to include others in the ownership of the corporation. The question has come up repeatedly and more frequently over the recent year, whether partners of the organization can also become shareholders. We, as founders, welcome the idea and want to make it possible. We won’t do this directly with the AG transformation, but it lays the foundation. Our goal for the future is to allow co-ownership of the company to long term employees.'

Most of the capital currently comes from loans – mainly by the shareholders in the shape of withheld dividends and withheld salaries.'
