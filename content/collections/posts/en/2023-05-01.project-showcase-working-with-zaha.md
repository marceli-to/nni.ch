        text: 'When we joined the project process, images of the building complex and the surrounding area already existed. They gave an overview of the site and illustrated its diverse uses. Therefore, we got the chance to surface the quality of the design on a different level. Our images aimed not to explain the project but to showcase specific design aspects.'

        text: "\_The elegantly curved roofs, overlaying in spatiality, expose the repetition of the shapes, almost like dimensions in time. The anonymous commuters are following those shapes, from left to right, right to left, day by day, like a never-ending stream of rain. But in contrast to this routine, the sun is twinkling through the clouds, creating sparkles on the reflecting surfaces. Thatâ€™s the story of the couple finding shelter under their umbrella, waiting for their grandchildren's long-desired arrival. The moment is filled with anticipation, delight, and hope for a bright future."
