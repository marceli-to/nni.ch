        text: "It has been ten months since Nightnurse Images made the switch to Holacracy. Things have changed both on an organizational level and on a strategic level. A general theme that has been implemented throughout the company is transparency. Meaning that everything from the company’s finances and project load to accountability and circle meetings is accessible to everyone in the company. This has generated fluctuation of communication across circles and roles in the company. We have found that letting everyone in on this information the general understanding for the company has developed. Now all employees are aware e.g. if we go into a project-intensive period, where there is need a little extra of everyone. This has helped us work together as a team not just on the project but also on the company.\_"

        text: 'Holacracy has changed our corporate language. Based on the notion that words are powerful and specific phrasing can change people’s perception and affect action. Our internal linguistic change has made it easier to communicate. Because people more specifically can direct and clarify their needs e.g. which of their own roles that need x from another role. Additionally, the language evolves with the company. We choose the names of roles ourselves, aiming at capturing the role’s accountability and purpose (which is forever changeable - if there is consensus - at any Governance Meeting regarding the circle the role exists within). Naturally, these new roles and related names become part of our corporate language and it constantly evolves in that way.'

        text: 'Former top-level employees count fewer meetings on their calendar because the meeting structure has become more organized. Employees at former first- and middle-level have experienced a slight increase in meetings in their calendars. However, these meetings have facilitated positive change as they aid information flow and knowledge-exchange between roles and circles. Additionally, meetings are not obligatory to attend, but everyone is encouraged to attend as many meetings as possible because of their great return on invested time.'
