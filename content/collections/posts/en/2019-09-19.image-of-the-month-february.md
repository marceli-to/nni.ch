        text: 'Every month we host a small internal competition at Nightnurse Images: Everyone submits their best work from the past month at a fixed date and an online vote gets cast. The winner is awarded the trophy (an original 70â€™s LiteBrite) to show on his desk for a month and receives a lunch voucher for a nice restaurant near the office. Also, they get to curate a showcase section of our website, visible to all visitors to our homepage.'
