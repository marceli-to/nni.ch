<p>Every month we host a small internal competition at Nightnurse Images: Everyone submits their best work from the past month at a fixed date and an online vote gets cast. The winner is awarded the trophy (an original 70's LiteBrite) to show on his desk for a month and receives a lunch voucher for a nice restaurant near the office. Also, they get to curate a showcase section of our website, visible to all visitors to our homepage. </p><p>Within this series of interviews, the IOTM-winner briefly outlines his/her work at Nightnurse Images, what inspires them and what the underlying theme was for their showcase selection.</p><p>Video: https://youtu.be/MyqBos9v_r4</p><p>IOTM Winner<br>Visualizer: Chris Payne</p><p>Image: 2019/11/19E57-Kollektiv-Marudo-WBW-Seebach-Zürich_INT_190828d-1024x585.jpg</p>www.nightnurse.ch</figcaption><p></p>
