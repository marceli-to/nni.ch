        text: ", we need to collect, share and spread the right doses of information in a way that makes the problem directly connected to us. Arid Zones and Climate Refugees are sometimes still too far away for us, too abstract. The problems have\_to touch us emotionally, they have to\_interrupt our daily habits and living areas and speak to our hearts. Otherwise, we won`t\_be able to absorb it\_fully\_and we won`t feel any need to act. If\_we\_look outside the window everything looks normal\_here in Zurich, or Cologne or Rome… except some FridaysForFuture demonstrations\_calling for our attention and\_staying on the ball."

Flipping through social media,\_I came with\_more and more articles, people\_and\_organizations\_across, dealing\_actively or passively with the climate and biodiversity emergency. It\_was not\_only\_the content, but it was\_also how\_it\_was communicated\_to me. The more the informations encroached my personal life\_(especially\_via words and visualized images like “When Sea Levels Attack”)\_and spoke to my heart (like the short film\_“Up At Night – a film by Nelson Makengo”) and the closer the scenarios reached me, the stronger the need for an action grew: to lead through mentally and reset some of my life areas\_and to\_find creative ways to act.\_For everything is connected and\_for\_we\_are all\_in this together, we need to reset everywhere together and change our everyday habits."
