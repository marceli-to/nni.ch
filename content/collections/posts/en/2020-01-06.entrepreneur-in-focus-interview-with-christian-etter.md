Which was why with my second  I decided to do things differently and I keep it small. For instance, we do not take more than three projects a year. To me, it is not about growing the company as big as possible. That is of course not the conventional idea for a successful company, but I realized that I had to find my own formula to make things work. And for me, this works well and I am happy. '

Then I remember that when I worked in Italy I asked a guy: “Why are so many cousins, uncles and so on employed in the same company?” And he told me that there was a problem within the legal system – this was in the time of Berlusconi – it would take six to seven years before a court case would get started and in that time the legal time limit to be accountable would be over. So the only way they could hold people accountable was by knowing their mother – so that you could call her and say “Hi, your child messed up, you need to fix this”. So we try to take mechanisms like that and apply it on a different subject.'

It is always super useful to have an outsider look at an idea or a prototype. For example, last week, we tested a virtual robot prototype on old people; above the age of 70. And we got some wonderful feedback because they seemed to be much more honest than younger people. They were not taken aback by the novelty, they focused more on its usefulness: Thinking in terms of “how is this useful to me”. '

        text: 'The process itself was mainly thinking about the three founders ; how they are each very different and bring their own strength to the company. And how that kind of creates a new common identity that is the company. And of course, what they do; thinking about how to turn an idea into a visualization, often in 3D. So, I was sort of combining these two things and that was how I came up with the logotype.'

Especially, when it comes to corporate identity, where such a small thing, like a logo, needs to do so many things. You simply can not compromise, you need to have one really good idea and go fully with that, instead of trying to merge too many things together.'
